They may include:

- Materials
- Hardware
- Components

Product features include:

- Optional components/materials/hardware
- Base and Max list prices

Products calculate:

- Base cost/Max cost
- Base profit/Max profit
- Quantity of BOM Items

### Product Options

Product options are designed for items that include optional 'add-ons'. By marking specific Bill of Materials (BOM) items as optional, you can define a 'Max List Price' for that product. This allows you to verify that your add-ons maintain your profit margin rather than reducing it.
