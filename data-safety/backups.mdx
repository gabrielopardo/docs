# Backup & Data Safety

Arc Manager is an **offline, local-first application**.

## Where Your Data Lives

C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming\Arc Manager\

Contents:
- `workspaces/` — One database per workspace
- `backups/` — Automatic daily backups
- `app_settings.db` — Settings and license info

## Automatic Backups

- Created once per day on first launch
- Last **7 backups** retained
- Stored locally

## Manual Backup & Restore

Available in **Settings → Backup & Restore**:
- Export as JSON
- Export as SQLite
- Restore from file

## Protecting Your Data

We recommend:
1. Copying the Arc Manager folder to an external drive
2. Creating manual exports after major changes
3. Optionally syncing backups with a cloud folder
