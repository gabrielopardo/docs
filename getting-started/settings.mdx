description: Customize Arc Manager to match how your shop works.
---

The **Settings** section lets you tailor Arc Manager to your shop’s workflow, terminology, and preferences. These options affect how information is displayed and organized throughout the app.

---

## Company Name

Set your **Company Name** to match your shop or business.

- Displayed in the application header
- Helps distinguish between workspaces if you manage multiple shops
- Does not affect calculations or inventory data

---

## Appearance

Choose how Arc Manager looks while you work.

- **Light Mode** — Bright, high-contrast layout
- **Dark Mode** — Reduced eye strain for long shop sessions

You can switch appearance at any time without restarting the app.

---

## Categories

Categories help organize materials, hardware, components, and products.

Examples:
- Steel
- Aluminum
- Fasteners
- Welding Supplies

Using categories makes it easier to filter lists, search inventory, and keep large datasets manageable.

---

## Hardware Types

Hardware Types define the structure of your hardware items.

Instead of treating all hardware the same, you can create custom types with fields that match what your shop actually tracks.

Example: **Bolt**
- Diameter
- Length
- Thread pitch
- Grade

Each hardware item you create uses a Hardware Type, ensuring consistent data entry and cleaner inventory records.

---

## Material Units

Material Units define how materials are measured and priced.

Common examples:
- `ft`
- `sq. ft.`
- `lb`
- `pcs`

Units are used throughout cost calculations and inventory tracking. Choose units that match how you purchase and consume materials in your shop.
